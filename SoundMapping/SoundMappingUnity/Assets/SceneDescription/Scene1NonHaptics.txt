Use the L Stick to move the drone and the R Stick to control the camera. Move the R Stick horizontally to rotate and vertically to adjust height.

A grey line shows your drone's predicted path. If you're about to collide with something, this line turns red and your controller vibrates.

The haptic jacket provides force feedback when you're near walls - test this by carefully approaching one. Watch out for invisible boundaries at level edges.

Remember: You must collect all stars to complete the level.
